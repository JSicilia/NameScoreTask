# NameTask

Task notes before starting:

Read the file and convert into an array
Function for calculating value. Correspond text values to numeric.. A=1, B=2 etc
Create seperate array for the values that were created. Potentially?? Could refer to later for more expansion to task?
Display sorted names with position?
Print score at end.


Challenges:

Some syntax issues, almost submitted it with the final console answer just being the final calculated value rather than the sum of it.
I did first use stream reader directly. Though when researching more into the functions I went with File.ReadAllText as it was much cleaner code wise with still using stream reader internally along with handling the resources better.
Structure, more design than challenge but calling a function into it rather than just doing it all in the main.

Continuation:
Add browsing for the file rather than it being in a specific place for the program.
Expand on this and create something with more GUI and a display of numbers instead of printing all console.
